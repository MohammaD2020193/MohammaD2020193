- âš¡ Fun fact: The first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace, who lived in the 19th century! Even before the first computers were physically built, Ada Lovelace wrote an algorithm intended for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer that was never completed. She is often credited with being the world's first programmer, and her work laid the foundation for the field of software engineering long before computers as we know them even existed!
